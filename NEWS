This is the 'NEWS' file for the 'ads-github-tools' project. This file contains
information on changes since the last release of the package, as well as a
running list of high-level changes from previous versions.  If critical bugs
are found in any of the software, notice of such bugs and the versions in
which they were fixed will be noted here, as well.

ads-github-tools 0.1.0 (2016-08-20)

    * Initial version of project. The project currently provides five command
      line programs:

      + ads-github-normalize-url: produces a "normalized" view of a given URL,
        suitable for use in generating an ID. Currently is a quick 'n dirty
        implementation optimized for this sole purpose, so there's no
        guarantee that the normalized variation of the URL will actually work

      + ads-github-hash-url: similar in spirit to `git-hash-object(1)`, this
        tool takes a (presumably normalized) URL and emits a checksum for
        it. Currently uses the SHA-3 256-bit algorithm variant.
  
      + ads-github-show-rate-limits: Show user's GitHub API rate limits
        ("core" and "search").

      + ads-github-fetch-all-upstreams: Operates on the working directories of
        a collection of GitHub-hosted git repositories. The user can specify
        one or more repositories explicitly to restrict operations to just
        those repos. Each that is found with an 'upstream' remote defined will
        have `git fetch upstream` invoked in it.
  
        - With the `--clone-if-missing` option, any of the user's GitHub repos
          for which there is not a git working directory beneath the current
          location will be cloned (using the `git-hub` tool's `clone`
          operation, which sets up the 'upstream' remote if the repo is a
          fork).

        - There's also an `--upstream-remote-if-missing` option that will add
          the 'upstream' remote on existing project working directories that
          do not have it (only if the project is a fork of another project, of
          course).
    
      + ads-github-merge-all-upstreams: Operates on the working directories of
        a collection of GitHub-hosted git repositories. Each that is found
        with both 'origin' and 'upstream' remotes defined will have `git merge
        --ff-only upstream/<DEFAULT_BRANCH_NAME>` invoked in it. The user can
        specify one or more repositories explicitly to restrict operations to
        just those repos. The program is careful to sanity check the local
        repository before attempting any operations on it. Also, it will skip
        any repository for which the git index has any changes recorded. Will
        (temporarily) check out the default branch before merging (if the
        working directory happens to have some other branch checked out); will
        restore the originally checked out branch when done if the temporary
        switch was necessary.

        - With the `--push` option, will invoke 'git push origin <DEFAULT_BRANCH_NAME>'
          for each repo.
