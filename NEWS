*** issue 17: ads-github-merge-all-upstreams: stderr message on failed ff merge indicates "bailing out", which is not always true

    https://github.com/salewski/ads-github-tools/issues/17

    In the version of 'ads-github-merge-all-upstreams' distributed as part of
    ads-github-tools-0.1.0, the tool would emit an incorrect "bailing out"
    message when the tool's '-k' (--keep-going) option was speecified and a
    fast-forward merge is not possible for some reason:

    :    $ ads-github-merge-all-upstreams -vkpp
    :    ...
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (info): [repo: "foobar"] currently checked-out branch ("master") is the default branch (no need for checkout)
    :    fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (error): [repo: "foobar"] was error while attempting to merge 'upstream/master'; bailing out
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (warning): '-k' (--keep-going) specified; continuing
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (info): [repo: "bazqux"] currently checked-out branch ("master") is the default branch (no need for checkout)
    :    Already up-to-date.
    :    ...

    That message is correct for the default behavior of the program (when the
    '-k' option is not specified, but when the '-k' option /is/ specified, the
    message should not have indicated that the program was "bailing out"; it
    was not correct, and gave the impression that the error detection is not
    working correctly.

    The program has been fixed to emit "context aware" messages in these
    scenarios. With the default invocation (no command line options specified)
    is the same as it was previously:

    :    $ ads-github-merge-all-upstreams
    :    ...
    :    fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (error): [repo: "foobar"] was error while attempting to merge 'upstream/master'; bailing out
    :
    :    $ echo $?
    :    1

    When the '-k' (--keep-going) option is specified, the error message
    related to the failed fast-forward merge no longer indicates that the
    program is "bailing out":

    :    $ ads-github-merge-all-upstreams -k
    :    fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (error): [repo: "serverless"] was error while attempting to merge 'upstream/master'
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (warning): '-k' (--keep-going) specified; continuing
    :    ...
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (error): one or more errors encountered with '-k' (--keep-going) specified (see error output above for details); bailing out
    :
    :    $ echo $?
    :    1

    Note that the error message from the 'git merge --ff-only ...' command
    invoked internally still indicates that it is "aborting". We hope that it
    is clear from context that that is not coming directly from the
    'ads-github-merge-all-upstreams' tool and that users are not confused by
    it.


*** issue 18: ads-github-merge-all-upstreams: suppress "no upstream changes to merge" messages unless verbose output requested

    https://github.com/salewski/ads-github-tools/issues/18

    The default output of the 'ads-github-merge-all-upstreams' program (that
    is, when the program is invoked with no command line options) was
    previously too chatty; it was emitting a bunch of "no upstream changes to
    merge" messages:

    :    ...
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (info): [repo: "foo"] no upstream changes to merge, and "aggressive push" (a al '-p -p') not specified; skipping (okay)
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (info): [repo: "bar"] no upstream changes to merge, and "aggressive push" (a al '-p -p') not specified; skipping (okay)
    :    ads-github-merge-all-upstreams (info): [repo: "baz"] no upstream changes to merge, and "aggressive push" (a al '-p -p') not specified; skipping (okay)
    :    ...

    The program now only emits those messages when the user requests verbose
    output via '-v' (--verbose) option.


** improvements

*** issue 16: ads-github-merge-all-upstreams: use 'git push origin heads/<BRANCH>' to avoid ambiguity with tags of the same name as <BRANCH>

    https://github.com/salewski/ads-github-tools/issues/16

    If a repository had a tag name that matched the default branch name
    (typically "master"), then the previous version of the program would not
    be able to push the merged changes to the origin repository because the
    git refspec used internally was ambiguous. The program has been enhanced
    to qualify the default branch name as "heads/<BRANCH>" rather than just
    "<BRANCH>" to remove this ambiguity.


* ads-github-tools 0.1.0 (2016-08-20)

** Initial version of project. The project currently provides five command line programs:

   + ads-github-normalize-url

     Produces a "normalized" view of a given URL, suitable for use in
     generating an ID. Currently is a quick 'n dirty implementation optimized
     for this sole purpose, so there's no guarantee that the normalized
     variation of the URL will actually work

   + ads-github-hash-url

     Similar in spirit to 'git-hash-object(1)', this tool takes a (presumably
     normalized) URL and emits a checksum for it. Currently uses the SHA-3
     256-bit algorithm variant.
  
   + ads-github-show-rate-limits

     Shows the user's GitHub API rate limits ("core" and "search").

   + ads-github-fetch-all-upstreams

     Operates on the working directories of a collection of GitHub-hosted git
     repositories. The user can specify one or more repositories explicitly to
     restrict operations to just those repos. Each that is found with an
     'upstream' remote defined will have 'git fetch upstream' invoked in it.
  
     - With the '--clone-if-missing' option, any of the user's GitHub repos
       for which there is not a git working directory beneath the current
       location will be cloned (using the 'git-hub' tool's 'clone' operation,
       which sets up the 'upstream' remote if the repo is a fork).

     - There's also an '--upstream-remote-if-missing' option that will add the
       'upstream' remote on existing project working directories that do not
       have it (only if the project is a fork of another project, of course).
    
   + ads-github-merge-all-upstreams

     Operates on the working directories of a collection of GitHub-hosted git
     repositories. Each that is found with both 'origin' and 'upstream'
     remotes defined will have:

     :    git merge --ff-only upstream/<DEFAULT_BRANCH_NAME>

     invoked in it. The user can specify one or more repositories explicitly
     to restrict operations to just those repos. The program is careful to
     sanity check the local repository before attempting any operations on
     it. Also, it will skip any repository for which the git index has any
     changes recorded. Will (temporarily) check out the default branch before
     merging (if the working directory happens to have some other branch
     checked out); will restore the originally checked out branch when done if
     the temporary switch was necessary.

     - With the '--push' option, will invoke:

       :    git push origin <DEFAULT_BRANCH_NAME>

       for each repo.
