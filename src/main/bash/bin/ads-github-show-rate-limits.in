# ads-github-show-rate-limits: Show user's GitHub API rate limits. Makes an
# authenticated HTTP 'HEAD' call to the GitHub API (using curl) to obtain the
# HTTP response headers that contain the service rate limit information. The
# rate limit information is parsed out of the headers and presented to the
# user.
#
# The default output (whitespace delimited columns of plain text) is suitable
# for a user working interactively in a shell and for use in a Unix shell
# pipeline.
#
# FIXME: A future version will provide options to allow the user to request
#        output in some specific formats (edn, json).
#
# All requests are made over HTTPS.
#
# Authentication
# ==============
# No authentication data is used directly; the curl(1) '-n' (--netrc) option
# is used, so the user is expected to have his GitHub credentials stored in a
# ~/.netrc file. For details on setting that up, see curl(1) and
# netrc(5). Note that curl will not use the ~/.netrc file if the permissions
# allow reading by group or other.
#
# HINT: The relevant line ~/.netrc file content should have the form:
#
#     machine api.github.com login YOUR_USER_NAME password YOUR_GITHUB_PASSWORD
#
# CAVEAT: Use of the netrc(5) configuration means that this tool is ultimately
# using username/password with the GitHub API. Though all communication is
# conducted over HTTPS (so is encrypted "on the wire"), this authentication
# mechanism allows this tool to access the full power of the GitHub API.
#
# DO NOT USE THIS TOOL UNLESS YOU TRUST THAT IT IS NOT ABUSING THIS TRUST.
#
# Use of the OAuth mechanisms would allow for the access needed by this
# program while preventing use of the access it does not need. I'm not
# worrying about that at the moment though, as I'm the only user, and I expect
# that anything more elaborate should probably be integrated into a more
# featureful tool (such as 'git-hub', which already has OAuth support).
#
# Motivation
# ==========
#
# When working with the programs provided by the 'ads-github-tools' project
# (or really any tool that makes calls to the GitHub API) you will want to be
# able to confirm that you are within your rate limit and how many requests
# you still have left before you hit your cap.
#
# You may also be working on a set of similar tools and just want to confirm
# that they are working as expected -- not incurring hits against your GitHub
# API rate limit when you do not expect them to.
#
#
# TODO
# ====
#
#     * Provide an option to allow user to request output in different formats
#       (edn, json, ...)
#

#
# To generate a man page for distribution (in a tarball or RPM, for instance),
# you'll probably want to run pod2man something like this:

#               > /outputdir/ads-github-show-rate-limits.1
#
# To inspect the page formatting, etc., you can pipe the above 'pod2man'
# command to:
#
#     'man -l -'
#

=head1 NAME

  ads-github-show-rate-limits - Show user's GitHub API rate limits


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ads-github-show-rate-limits --help
  ads-github-show-rate-limits --version

  ads-github-show-rate-limits [OPTION...]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<ads-github-show-rate-limits> program is part of the C<ads-github-tools>
project.

The C<ads-github-show-rate-liimits> program requests the user's rate limit
information from GitHub and displays it on stdout.

The program makes an authenticated HTTP 'HEAD' call to the GitHub API (using
C<curl(1)>) to obtain the HTTP response headers that contain the service rate
limit information. The rate limit information is parsed out of the headers and
presented to the user.

The default output (whitespace delimited columns of plain text) is suitable
for a user working interactively in a shell and for use in a Unix shell
pipeline.

A future version will provide options to allow the user to request output in
some specific formats (edn, json).

All requests are made over HTTPS.

FIXME: docs still a wip


=head2 Motivation

When working with the programs provided by the C<ads-github-tools> project (or
really any tool that makes calls to the GitHub API) you will want to be able
to confirm that you are within your rate limit and how many requests you still
have left before you hit your cap.

You may also be working on a set of similar tools and just want to confirm
that they are working as expected -- not incurring hits against your GitHub
API rate limit when you do not expect them to.


=head1 OPTIONS

Below are the command line options currently accepted by
C<ads-github-show-rate-limits>.


=over 4

=item --help

Print help usage message


=item -V, --version

Print the version of the program to stdout and then exit.


=item -h, --human-readable

Causes numbers and dates to be printed in human readable format, for example:

    "1,324,835" rather than "1324835"

and:

    "2016-05-22 07:59:18-04:00" rather than "1463918358"

By default, numbers and dates are presented in the same format as they are
returned by the upstream GitHub service; this allows downstream tools to
process them without having to parse some (more complicated) human-readable
format. In this format, dates are represented as seconds since the Unix epoch.

When the C<-h> (C<--human-readable>) option is is specified, then numbers will
be presented in a locale-aware format, and dates will be formatted to the
second in RFC 3339 format.

A future version will allow dates to be presented in UTC.


=item -v, --verbose

Turn on verbose mode. Causes program to emit messages on C<stderr> indicating
what it is doing. The option may be specified multiple times to increase
fruther the level of verbosity. One C<-v> option enables info-level output;
two such opts enable debug-level output; three or more enable trace-level
output.


=item --

Signals the end of options and disables further options processing.

=back


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Exits with zero on success, non-zero on error.


=head1 BUGS

=over 4

=item Probably tons

If you find any, please report them as described in the C<BUGS> file.
