# curl-gh-fout-q: Wrapper around the 'curl-gh-fout' program to "layer in"
# configuration to suppress the curl(1) progress meter and other non-error
# output.
#
# Of the 'curl-gh*' set of programs, this one most closely mimics the behavior
# of the various 'ads-github-tools' programs. The the HTTP response body will
# be written to the user-specified filepath, and the HTTP response code will
# be emitted on stdout.
#
# The curl progress meter, etc., will be suppressed. If you do wish to see
# that output, you may be interested in the 'curl-gh-fout' script, instead
# (which this one wraps).
#
# Invokes curl(1) configured to talk to GitHub over TLS 1.2 (or
# higher). Basically sets up command line options to curl(1) in a way similar
# to how it is done by the 'ads-github-tools', for easy interactive use on the
# command line.
#
# The user must provide two required (positional) params:
#
#     1. GitHub URL (or path; see below) to invoke
#
#     2. Output filepath for HTTP response body
#
# As a common-case optimization, if the value provided for the GitHub URL
# starts with a '/' character, then it will be interpreted as the start of a
# URL path that will be prepended to:
#
#     https://api.github.com
#
# This saves the user from having to remember and specify that unchanging URL
# base, and can also save some typing. Thus, the following two invocations are
# effectively identical:
#
#     $ curl-gh-fout-q 'https://api.github.com/user/repos' '/tmp/rsp.out'
#
#     $ curl-gh-fout-q '/user/repos' '/tmp/rsp.out'
#
# As a special case, if the very first option on the command line is
# '--no-act', then the curl command line that would otherwise be run is simply
# printed to stdout. This is useful not only for understanding what the tool
# is doing, but also for copying the command for use for manual editing on the
# command line (sometimes you want /most/ of the behavior here, but not all of
# it...)
#
# Any additional command line options will be passed through to curl(1). Some
# curl options might interfere with the correct functioning of this program;
# no attempt is made to detect such conflicts.
#
# Note that no particular request method (GET, POST, PUT, ...) is specified by
# the default options (which means that the default curl behavior of
# defaulting to GET will be used) unless a user-provided option causes some
# other method to be used. This is just like when using curl directly.
#
#
# Usage:
#     curl-gh-fout-q [--no-act] GH_URL OUTPUT_FPATH [CURL_OPT...] 
#
#
# HINT: The mnemonic for remembering the order of the params is that they
#       resemble the order of 'cp(1)':
#
#           $ cp SOURCE DEST
#
#       Conceptually, you are taking the data from (emitted by) the URL, and
#       storing it in OUTPUT_FPATH:
#
#           $ curl-gh-fout-q GH_URL OUTPUT_FPATH

usage: ${PROG} GITHUB_URL OUTPUT_FILE [CURL_OPT...]

Invokes curl-gh-fout, which itself wraps curl(1) configured to invoke the
GitHub v3 API. The HTTP response output is written to OUTPUT_FILE. The HTTP
response code is written to stdout.
